Question for Elisabeth

1. Confirm full preprocessing work flow
	1. clean data
	2. extract epochs
	3. run ica on epochs - exclude eye components
	4. artifact rejections: threshold and channels of interest



2. Unit of beta power: mV^2

3. Latency of beta power: for each phase

4. Topography map
- topo locations
- specify time windows: pre, dur, post


5. If alpha: run new script or same-script computation

8. Cleaning biosemi: Blow dry electrodes after wash

9. normalize beta power per participant
baseline - move - pos

(trial power)/(avg power of C3 in all exp)

unit: normalized power
